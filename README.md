# CODSOFT


Results of tasks assigned by CODSOFT during the internship are available in this repository.

Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict passenger survival. Using the Titanic dataset that I downloaded from the Kaggle website, I followed Codsoft's project guidelines. I used Python and Scikit-Learn to implement logistic regression, and I developed a model to predict whether or not the passenger survived by using logistic regression to train a binary classification model.

Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction: In this task, I developed a machine learning model for Movie Rating Prediction using the Kaggle IMDB dataset. I used the Linear Regression approach to make predictions for this project. To prepare the data for modeling, we first processed the data and represented it using numerous charts for analysis. Next, we performed feature engineering. Lastly, we used evaluation indicators to rate the performance of our model.

Task 3: IRIS Flower Classification: In accordance with the project's Codsoft guidelines, the objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can identify the type of iris flower using data retrieved from the Kaggle website. I used Python and Scikit-Learn to develop different categorization algorithms for this project. Evaluation metrics are used to calculate and establish the model's accuracy. These procedures led us to conclude that the Random Forest Classifier method performs more efficiently in training, while the Logistic Regression model performs more accurately in both test and train data.
